			<p> I have always been very interested in history, and I love learning about 
				the past. Also, I enjoy learning about DNA and heredity. With these
				two interests of mine, it was natural for me to want to do a 23&me DNA 
				test. I wanted to learn about my own history. So, for my 16th birthday, my 
				parents bought me a kit that tested my genetic traits and ancestry, and I 
				sent my sample in. 
			</p>
			<p> When I got my results back, I was not very surprised. 
				 My ancestry results were: 
			</p>
				<ul> <!--This is an unordered list-->
					<li> 85.5% South Asian </li>
					<li> 10.4% Middle Eastern </li>
					<li> 1.8% European (Southern & Northwestern) </li>
					<li> 0.6% East Asian (Southeastern & Siberian) </li>
					<li> 1.8% Unassigned </li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				Of course, I knew that I was going to be South Asian because my family 
				is from Pakistan and parts of Northern India (before Partition), so 
				that was a given. I just wish that 23&me had a greater sample size, so 
				specific ethnic groups could be added because South Asia is full of 
				extremely diverse groups of people. I knew I had Middle Eastern DNA 
				because my maternal great-grandmother was Iranian. I suspected that I had 
				European DNA because the British Empire had colonized South Asia for two 
				hundred years. In my family, it has been passed on that we are direct 
				descendants of Genghis Khan. I don't know how much credibility is in that
				since practically the whole continent of Asia and much of Europe is 
				related to him. However, the Siberian DNA could be a remnant of the Mongol
				Empire in me. I was a bit disappointed at the 1.8% unassigned, which 
				means that 23&me could not pinpoint exactly where some DNA segments were
				from because the algorithm requires more data to make my results more 
				accurate.
